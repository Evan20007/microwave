## Rflection
Working on the microwave design was a great experience, but it wasnâ€™t without its challenges. One of the biggest struggles was getting the slow-motion door opening to look realistic. It took a lot of tweaking and testing to make sure it felt smooth.

Another challenge was the timer functionality. At first, it was hard to get the timer to update properly and match the actual microwave experience. But after some adjustments, we managed to get everything working as expected.

Even though there were some tough moments, we learned a lot. The final result feels satisfying, and we're happy with how everything came together.##
